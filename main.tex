% % The following packages are needed because unicode
% % is translated (using the next set of packages) to
% % latex commands. You may need more packages if you
% % use more unicode characters:

% \usepackage{amssymb}
% \usepackage{bbm}
% \usepackage[greek,english]{babel}

% % This handles the translation of unicode to latex:

% \usepackage{ucs}
% \usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
% % \usepackage{autofe}

% % Some characters that are not automatically defined
% % (you figure out by the latex compilation errors you get),
% % and you need to define:

% \DeclareUnicodeCharacter{8988}{\ensuremath{\ulcorner}}
% \DeclareUnicodeCharacter{8989}{\ensuremath{\urcorner}}
% \DeclareUnicodeCharacter{8803}{\ensuremath{\overline{\equiv}}}

% Add more as you need them (shouldn't happen often).
