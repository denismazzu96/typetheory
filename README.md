Workbook for Type Theory course Maietti Sambin at the University of Padua, 2019.

## Getting Started
You can easily find all the exercises that I have done for the course in [main.pdf](main.pdf).
All the exercises respect a theory called MLâ‚€ from Professor Maietti, this theory is a framment of Martin-Lof Type Theory with a restricted type of propositional equality.
In addition the same exercises are carried out also in agda in [this file (TypeTheory.agda)](agda-scripts/TypeTheory.agda).
